Paper: Impact of early nutrition and feeding route on clinical outcomes of neurocritically ill patients

Objective:

The study aimed to explore the relationship between early nutrition and clinical outcomes in patients admitted to a neurosurgical ICU.
It sought to identify the optimal timing, route, and formula for nutrition, with a focus on comparing early enteral nutrition (EEN) and early parenteral nutrition (EPN).

Methodology & Instrument:

Conducted as a retrospective single-center observational study at the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, South Korea.
Included patients from the neurosurgical ICU between January 2013 and December 2019, who were hospitalized for over 5 days due to neurocritical conditions or postoperative care.

Reason:

Nutrition support is critical in managing critically ill patients, impacting neurological prognosis and mortality, especially in those with stroke or traumatic brain injuries.
The study was driven by the need to understand the impact of early nutrition on such patients, given the potential benefits and the current uncertainties regarding the optimal nutrition strategy.

Data:

The study period saw 12,743 admissions, with 1,353 patients meeting the inclusion criteria for the final analysis.
Early nutrition was provided to 384 (28.4%) of these patients, with 152 (11.2%) receiving EEN and 232 (17.1%) receiving EPN.

Results:

In the overall study population, the rate of in-hospital mortality was higher in patients with late nutrition compared to those with early nutrition. No significant differences in in-hospital mortality and infectious complications between the late and early nutrition groups in the PSM and PSOW adjusted population 
In this image, the overlap between the two distributions suggests that the matching process was relatively successful, meaning that the treatment and control groups are comparable in terms of the covariates included in the propensity score model. This allows for a more accurate estimation of the effect of early nutrition on the clinical outcomes being studied.
